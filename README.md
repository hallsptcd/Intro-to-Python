# Introduction to Python
This is my "Introduction to Python" Notebook. It's designed as an introduction to the world of Python. 
We'll begin with a review of data types, operators, functions, and then move to the main data structures used in Python: tuples, lists, dictionaries and sets. 
We will also look at more advanced features, such as lambdas and list comprehensions.
